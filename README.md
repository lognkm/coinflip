# coinflip
c# coinflip program using random

Write an app that simulates coin tossing. Let the app toss a coin each time the user chooses the "Toss Coin" menu option. 
Count the number of times each side ofthe coin appears. Display the results. 
[If the app realistically simulates coin tossing, each side of the coin should appear approximately half the time.]
